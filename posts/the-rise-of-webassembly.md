WebAssembly (Wasm) is changing the landscape of web development. Traditionally, JavaScript has been the only language that runs natively in the browser. While JavaScript has evolved significantly, it still has limitations when it comes to performance-critical tasks.

## What is WebAssembly?

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

## Why use it?

1. **Performance**: Wasm executes at near-native speed by taking advantage of common hardware capabilities.
2. **Language Choice**: Developers can write code in languages like C, C++, Rust, and Go, and compile it to run in the browser.
3. **Security**: Wasm runs in a memory-safe, sandboxed execution environment.

## The Future

With the adoption of WASI (WebAssembly System Interface), we are seeing Wasm move beyond the browser to the server side, edge computing, and even IoT. It opens up new possibilities for sharing code across different platforms without sacrificing performance.

As the ecosystem matures, we can expect to see more hybrid applications that leverage the ease of JavaScript for UI and the power of WebAssembly for computation.
