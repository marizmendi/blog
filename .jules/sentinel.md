## 2026-01-14 - Robust XSS Prevention in Markdown
**Vulnerability:** Markdown content processed by `remark-html` can contain raw HTML. If sanitization is disabled to allow HTML formatting, it opens the door to XSS attacks via `<script>` tags or javascript links.
**Learning:** `remark-html` (v15+) sanitizes by default but strips ALL HTML. To support rich content (safe HTML) while blocking attacks, we need a dedicated sanitizer.
**Prevention:** Configure `remark-html` with `{ sanitize: false }` to pass raw HTML, then pipe the output through `isomorphic-dompurify` to enforce a strict security policy that removes XSS vectors while preserving safe tags.
